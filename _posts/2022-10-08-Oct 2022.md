<b>The limitation of our tools</b>

Nothing can be known for certain in this world. 
 
Our senses are the primary means of observing the world, but they cannot be trusted because they are not reliable and do not give accurate information about the world.
 
There's a whole spectrum of information that is outside our own ability to perceive them i.e. outside our senses. This is true for both for our visual and auditory senses.
 
On top of that, our mind interprets and alters the information that is gained through our senses.
 
For example, in our visual field there are blood vessels and other blobs that block our vision. However, our brain is able to fill in the missing gaps and give us a consistent and full visual picture of the world.

Even though the tools we create will get us closer to absolute truth, we have no way to confirm the reality of our existence outside of itself. 
 
<b>The purest form of the truth</b>

Truth in the purest sense cannot be observed because our senses alter and disrupt the information present in the world. Therefore, truth can only be known in terms of what can be understood through our senses. In other words, we can never understand absolute truth. We can only understand truth as it seems to us or what is considered as relative truth.
 
Some think that we should dismiss the search for truth completely because truth can never be understood since our senses are limited, but this is a flawed argument because there is still truth that can be understood which is, however, going to be relative to our ability to perceive the world.

By comparing our truths, we can refine it, but at the same time, we will all have the same limitations with our tools, that is, we have the same senses. 

People cannot make up their own truth because relative truth for our species still exists. Ignoring that would be the death of science and the death of all that can be understood in this world. It would be the equivalent of pretending to be blind and embracing ignorance. 

<b>Truth as it relates to us</b>

Not to mention that we are only interested in truth as it relates to us, and not truth in the absolute sense. It is rather impossible to understand truths outside of its relation to us, even though people may try to claim that their search for truth goes beyond that. 
  
So the search for the truth is always going to be towards the relative truth. Truth is also not relative to the individual, but relative to our species, to our existence. So we must try to strive and understand truth as it is for our species.
 
<b>The evolving truth</b>

Our senses limit our ability to perceive the truth even relative truth. In other words, not all information is readily available to be perceived by our senses. For example, you might not have all the information visually present in front of you or in terms that can be understood by you. Therefore, as more information is made available or can be understood, this relative truth should be refined continuously, which brings it to the closest ideal form of relative truth.
 
The relative truth is always going to be evolving with new information. Everything is only true to the extent that the information that is understood and available to you. 

Relative truth is true according to what is known now, and new information should always change it.
